A sample program to read and display an image in JavaFX panels. By default, this program will read in the first frame of a given .rgb video file.


To run the code from command line, first compile with:

>> javac ImageCompression.java

and then, you can run it to take in two parameters "image.rgb" and "n":

>> java ImageCompression image.rgb n

where the parameter "n" is a "dummy" parameter used to give an additional example of command line args in Java.
